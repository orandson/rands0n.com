<p>Finding a good developer is hard.</p>

<p>People always complain of few qualified candidates who receive. They post their job openings know to each list. They do all this in the hope that a larger stack of resumes will yield at least one contract that comes to your standards.</p>

<p>The problem with this strategy is that it will not improve the quality of their candidate. More CVs means more time considering the people you will never hire. And if your company is most like others, you don’t have time for this.</p>

<p>The best way to find good developers is not to wait for them to come to you. You go out and find them. As most of us know, the traditional way of hiring is outdated.</p>

<p>In this article, I’ll show you a different way to find good developers to work in your company. What I hope is to help as many people possible.</p>

<h2 id="the-strategy">The Strategy</h2>

<p>Every company we know use the method of recommendation or any another method to hire developers. They eliminate a good portion of people who do not the job for which you are hiring. Someone on your team know any developer who can do what you need. Mark an interview, and then company hires.</p>

<p>The problem is that many developers do not know good developers. And most companies(specially small) are no references quickly.</p>

<p>The technique I recommend aims to capture the best aspects of references without firsthand knowledge. This technique is intended to find people who already have a proven knowledge to perform this function.</p>

<p>How? Simple, look at <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2 id="open-source">Open Source</h2>

<p>Okay, it’s obviously more complicated look at GitHub. GitHub have million users and the most of them will not do for you.</p>

<p>Thus the challenge of finding a good developer is narrower.</p>

<p>If you company is an agency, the most of software you use is Open Source. And you’ll probably want to hire someone who knows how to use it. That’s where the open source comes in, you can not only see the code. You can also take a look at contributors.</p>

<p>You can take the tool authors in question, to contact and talk about a job offer. But make no mistake, guys like John Resig, Douglas Crockford, among others. You can not hire them. Or it may be that they really want works for you. But, back to the subject. Exist the collaborators.</p>

<p>A quick look at the contributors flap design. You can see the colaborators(million of them). Analyze their contributions at the repository and see their qualities. If he is involved with the tool, no matter how small is your contribution. He is part of that group of users that make use of the tool. And that’s what you’re looking for, people who know how to use that tool in question.</p>

<p>Being more specific, you saw thousands of contributors in the project and still not know where to start. A tip is to go by opening the profile of each, analyzing their contributions and seeing their repositories. The more likes the repository is, more popular it is. The followers of this repository also have very. The more followers a person is, better. So she contributes to the community, no matter way. Being improvement code, lectures, anything. More followers means more people know that person or liked their contributions.</p>

<p>Looking organizations that the person participes, you can see on which niche it is inserted.</p>

<p>Here is a list of repositories you can see your contributors.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap">Bootstrap</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js">AngularJS</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery">jQuery</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/yahoo/pure">Pure CSS</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There are millions, look the better for you.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem!</h2>

<p>You searched in organizations, repositories and found a guy who knows the subject. It has some repositories on your profile that make use of that tool you use in the company. Like much of his work and would like to have it on your company.</p>

<p>The problem is that he is from another state, often in another country. So how I hire that person to work in my company? One answer: <strong>remote work</strong>.</p>

<p>By contacting the professional, you can discuss working hours wages and benefits that you can give to your new employee. And then, you have a guarantee that caught the right professional to work on your business. Directly from the tool you want to let them know.</p>

<p>We know that that you may experience other implications of people away.</p>

<p>Examine how best to hire this professional and make your considerations.</p>

<h2 id="why-colaborators">Why Colaborators?</h2>

<p>We know that many professionals are not present in the repositories or organizations you want. And many people did not cooperate with that project. But they know how to use these tools very well. And many have already made quite a few projects with her.</p>

<p>Thinking about these professionals. If they did not get to share their codes or minimum report a problem to the repository. Certainly he did not come for you to hire him. We know that there are exceptions and there are many people out there who do not share their code and are great professionals.</p>

<p>But, why not get in touch with a person who knows the tool? Participating in its development. Even if it bug report, testing to the tool. There are several ways you look at that person you want to hire.</p>

<p>In GitHub you’ll find the right professional, one community member, event participant related to the area in question. And by the end, a lover of technology.</p>

<h2 id="considerations">Considerations</h2>

<p>This was one of the ways I want to share with you. I hope I can help you in fight to find a good developer.</p>

<p>We know that there are several ways for you to find developers for your company without using a Open Source World for that. I hope you find my thoughts and give opportunities for people to help the Open Source World. They deserve attention in particular.</p>
