There is hardly any reason anymore to use `var _this = this` or other name to store the value of `this`
for future use. Before ES6, it was a necessity of code to be littered with references to `this` due date to each
function binding `this` to this own scope. For Example:

{% highlight javascript %}

Framebuffer.prototype.invert = function() {
    var _this = this;

    this.memory.map(function(location) {
        return _this._invertLocation(location);
    });
}

Framebuffer.prototype._invertLocation = function(location) {
    // code goes here
}

{% endhighlight %}

Arrow functions introduce lexical scope for functions, so that the value of this in an arrow function is
bound to the calleeâ€™s scope. The relevant portion in the above example could be rewritten as:

{% highlight javascript %}
Framebuffer.prototype.invert = (location) => {
    this.memory.map(
        location => this._invertLocation(location)
    );
}

Framebuffer.prototype._invertLocation = (location) => {
    // code goes here
}
{% endhighlight %}

The line in the first example declaring `_this` may be removed entirely.
