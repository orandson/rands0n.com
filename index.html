<p>Hi, I'm <strong>Randson</strong>.</p>

<p>I'm a Software Engineer, interested in Computer Science and the craft of programming. For over 5 years I've been helping companies to build quality software that helps their customers.</p>

<p>Experienced in IT Business, product management, team building and software development. Striving to learn data and process analysis.</p>

<p>In spare time, likes listening to new songs, practice basic exercises and drink different styles of beers. </p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Striving to make the world a better place to live, through technology.</p>

<p>This demands many things, like a permanent effort to look for dots who are asking to be connected, find and follow a solid way to do it so. It also demands sharp eyes for evidence-based conclusions, and to be aware of wishful thinking ideas.</p>
