I'm a curious person truly passionate about web stuff and excited about everything related to the programming and computer science. Working in the entire proccess of development is important to me. I like to see what's going on in the back-end as well as it will be in the front-end.

I use `js` username but it has nothing to do with Javascript. It’s a nickname when I was child. My friends called me Jarthis and I’ve used this in social medias, emails signatures and elsewhere.

We can talk on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/randsonjs) or email ([randsonjs _at_ gmail [dot] com](mailto:{{ site.email }})), so feel comfortable to say hello anytime you want. Also, I love hacking on [GitHub](https://github.com/randsonjs).

## This blog

A place to rest my thoughts on what I love and what I think that needs to be changed. **A home out here**. Sometimes I write in Portuguese(my native language). If you’re interested in my thoughts on something, let me know, and maybe it’ll turn into my next article.
